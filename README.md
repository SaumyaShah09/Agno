# Agno Projects Repository

## ðŸ¤– What is Agno?

[Agno](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno) is an open-source Python library that helps language model agents critique and improve their own outputs. It enables LLMs to reason more deeply by reflecting on their responses â€” enhancing accuracy, coherence, and decision-making through internal feedback loops.

Agno is especially useful in applications that benefit from iterative refinement, like writing assistants, planning agents, and memory-augmented reasoning tools.

This repository showcases small but powerful projects built with **Agno** to demonstrate how agents can self-reflect, improve, and retain context using modern LLM techniques.

## ðŸ“‚ Notebooks Overview

### 1. [Self-critiquing-mini-writer.ipynb](./Self-critiquing-mini-writer.ipynb)  
Build a mini writing agent that uses Agno to **generate**, **evaluate**, and **refine** its own responses. A practical use-case of self-reflection in LLMs, great for improving output quality in writing tasks.

### 2. [memory-based-agent.ipynb](./memory-based-agent.ipynb)  
Create an LLM agent that retains and recalls contextual memory across interactions. Combines Agnoâ€™s reasoning loop with a simple memory mechanism to enable continuity in multi-turn conversations.
